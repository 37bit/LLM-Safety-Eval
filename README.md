### LLM Safety Evaluation

This is a group project for the CS427 course (AI Safety) at the Singapore Management University (SMU), done by a 4-person team. In this project, we evaluate the safety of an AI model based on 3 dimensions:

- Robustness
- Hallucination
- Backdoor

The AI model selected for this project is [ContactDoctor/Bio-Medical-Llama-3-8B](https://huggingface.co/ContactDoctor/Bio-Medical-Llama-3-8B), a biomedical-focused model fine-tuned from Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct.
The details of our findings are written in Report.docx.
